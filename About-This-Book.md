# About This Book

In these pages, I have combined my reflections on major Ayurvedic texts with my years of experience in yoga and tantra to give you the essence of health and well-being. To make the most out of this book, read it patiently, as if chewing gum, to enjoy and absorb the knowledge contained herein.

Although I received my formal education in information technology and business, for years I have practiced healing and experimented across the disciplines of astrology, mantra, tantra, meditation, and alchemy. While Ayurvedic texts mostly focus on physical health and yogic scriptures on mental well-being, tantric scriptures pay attention to the metaphysical aspects of our existence.

When we synthesize the wisdom across the three disciplines of Ayurveda, yoga, and tantra, we gain a unique and holistic understanding of health. All three insist that we are an integral part of nature, and anything that happens in the play of nature affects us. Therefore, the more you are in harmony with nature, the more peaceful and healthy you will be. The objective of this book is to help you see how your body—your health and well-being—is intricately linked to Mother Nature, and how living in harmony with nature brings changes in your own nature.

I have always been passionate about health and natural remedies. So much so, I once owned an Ayurvedic health care company with a research team composed of some of the most brilliant Ayurvedic doctors in India. During the clinical trials of our products, I had the opportunity to meet and interview many patients. Except for Vishy’s example (in Chapter 6), all case studies in this book are real. I have only changed the names and, at times, places to protect the privacy of the individuals concerned. I have mostly used the masculine pronoun in general references for convenience purposes only; the teachings of Ayurveda and yoga are universally applicable.

I hope this book motivates you to lead a more natural, healthier, and more peaceful life.

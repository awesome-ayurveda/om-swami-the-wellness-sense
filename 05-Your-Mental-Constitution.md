# Your Mental Constitution

Omar, in his late forties, was a senior executive at a multi-billion-dollar telecommunications company. He had been happily married for twenty-one years and had a son and a daughter, both in their teens. He worked out at the gym and ate organic foods. He was in control of his professional life. The whole world, including his wife, saw Omar as a successful and happy man. He brought presents for his wife and took his family out to dinner. They would vacation in a new country for two weeks every year. He managed his personal and professional relationships well. All in all, you couldn’t possibly think that he had any problem.

Omar was healthy until recently when, out of the blue, he had three severe episodes of anxiety attacks with heart palpitations within two weeks. He confided in me, saying that he was torn from the inside and lived in a constant state of fear and helplessness. He thought God was punishing him because he had been sleeping with other women for years. He had started this in the fourth year of his marriage, when his wife was pregnant with their first child, seventeen years ago, he said.

Omar told me, "I love my wife to bits. She’s the perfect wife. I can’t imagine living without her and I love my children. I don’t want to wreck my family and my life, but I’m addicted, Swami. I’m addicted to sex. A million times I’ve promised myself that I will not do this to my wife, but a million times I’ve broken my own promise. I live with this constant guilt. I don’t want to do this, but I can’t help it. I have tried curbing it, I’ve tried distracting myself, but nothing works. I know my wife will leave me if she ever finds out.

"When I look at her, I feel terrible for being disloyal to her for so long. I buy her gifts, I take her on vacations, I donate to charities, I pray, I do everything to somehow make me feel light, but it all fails. My past haunts me and the present tortures me. Sometimes in the middle of a meeting, sometimes while on the treadmill, sometimes in bed, other times while reading, sometimes while watching a movie, I get these thoughts that really worry me. Even if I stop now, what will happen if something from the past springs up? I want to change, Swami. I’m tired of being like this. Please tell me why I am like this. What do I do? How do I fix myself? I think very soon I’m going to die of a heart attack. I can’t take it any more."

Omar broke down. I could see his helplessness.

"Omar," I said, "I’ll ask you just two questions. If the answer is yes to both of them, I know I’ll be able to help you. If not, you’ll have to see a therapist.

"Anything, Swami."

"Was your father an aggressive man? And did your mother put up with his aggression?"

"Yes, Swami. Sometimes she answered back, but it was always a mistake because first my father would shout at her and then withdraw for days and weeks at a stretch to punish her. The atmosphere at home would be extremely tense and unbearable.

"Okay then, Omar. I know what we need to do. I’m not a psychologist or a therapist. But I will tell you that you have to become a strict vegetarian, and you have to practice a certain type of meditation. I promise you’ll see the results within three months."

Omar emailed me every two weeks with a progress report. Three months later, he saw me again and said he hadn’t ever felt as light, energetic, calm, or happy. Meditation and a change in his diet worked for him. It has been over two years, and his sexual urges no longer drive him insane. He wanted to know how and why it worked, but more than that, he was intrigued. What did his father’s aggression or mother’s suffering have to do with his sexual temperament and conduct? And particularly, how did becoming a vegetarian impact his sexual addiction?

From my perspective, it was quite simple. Just like the three physical humours, there’s a certain genetic mental disposition everyone is born with. This relates to the mental, or psychical, humours: they are purity (sattva), passion (rajas), and aggression (tamas). Omar was not conceived in an act of love but lust. His father must have been aggressive at the time. Like an animal, he was simply looking for an outlet to sate his lust. His mother was unhappy in the relationship and felt betrayed, for her husband’s actions had no care, tenderness, or love. In the mixture of passion and lust, in the combination of confusion and indifference, Omar was conceived. I asked him to become a vegetarian because non-vegetarian food is tamasic in nature. Although I’ve seen many vegetarians with similar issues, I particularly wanted Omar to stay off anything that strengthened his genetic disposition.

He was born out of passion and aggression and, as a result, for the better part of his adult life, Omar experienced uncontrollable sexual urges. Aggression doesn’t always mean that you yell or are feisty. Many people express it by withdrawing from others. Either way, it is tamas. Withdrawing to avoid someone is not the same as withdrawing to punish her. Tamas can express itself in the form of extreme negative emotions: anger, hatred, or aggression. Omar’s tamas was not in his behavior towards his wife but in his untamed libido. Our mental humours are the primary driving force behind our habits. Whether they are eating, sleeping, sexual, or social habits, behind all our reactive and impulsive actions, the subtle forces of nature are at work. These are called the modes of material nature. They have the same name as the mental humours. In fact, the scriptures make no distinction between individual dispositions and the modes of material nature. They are identical because we are nature.

Ayurveda specifically documents the correlation and interdependence between one’s mental and physical states. Your state of mind affects your physical health, and your physical health impacts your mental state. Just as your physical body is governed by the three humours, your mind is governed by the three mental humours. The physical humours are called dosha, which literally means fault, principally because they require the most careful balance. An excess in any dosha is never good for the body. Doshas must be balanced and moderated. The mental humours, on the other hand, are not called dosha but guna. Guna means quality.

Taking a cue from yogic and Vedic texts, Ayurveda recognizes that the humours of the mind cannot be absolutely bad or absolutely good. They are subjective. Aggression of the mind may be detrimental to your digestion, but if you are a soldier out on the battlefield, you need adrenaline pumping through your body: you need that aggression to fight, to survive – to do your job. Hence, the humours of the mind are known as virtues or qualities because it’s not so much about what we have, as much as it is about how we use what we have.

The health of your nervous system, vitals, and digestion – and the strength of your immune system – have a direct and definitive correlation with the three mental humours. Unlike the physical humours, these three humours are not permanent. They are forever fluctuating in every individual. Sometimes rajas will win over tamas, other times tamas will win over rajas, and sometimes sattva will win over both. This constant struggle between the humours is the cause of varying moods and mental states in people. Anyone in a physical body is affected by the mental humours. With mindful and righteous living, it is possible to tame the fluctuations to a great degree, directly improving your physical and mental health. Let me elucidate the three humours for you.
